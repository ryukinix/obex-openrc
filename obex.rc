# DESCRIPTION:
#
# OBEX is a file-sharing protocol designed to working with Bluetooth
# wireless technology. obexd is a necessary daemon to be running for
# receive/sending over bluetooth works properly on Linux.
#
# NOTE: Since obexd has the following properties:
#
# 1. It's a user-wise service (run one for your user);
# 2. need DBUS session to talk to another bluetooth daemons and frontend;
# 3. Need X11 service running as well.
#
# I'd recommend initializing the obexd daemon in the initialization of
# the windows manager. I solved my main problems with it that way:
# put in the autorun of my AwesomeWM script.
# I'm publish this file just for historical reasons. I'm not using this
# anymore.
